The system generates movie recommendations based on the user's watchlist and provides statistical insights on user preferences.

- **Watchlist management**: Users can add movies to their watchlist, remove movies from the watchlist, and view their personalized watchlist.
- **Movie recommendations**: The system generates movie recommendations based on the user's watchlist and recommends similar movies that the user may like.
